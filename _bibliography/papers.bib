   abstract = {This paper aims at presenting the guidelines to follow in order to set up an identification procedure which is able to determine the axial force, the flexural rigidity and the rotational end stiffnesses of slender and tensioned structural elements, based on measurements of their natural frequencies and mode shapes. First of all, when such an element is slightly affected by bending stiffness effects, perturbation methods can be applied to get a composite approximation for its natural frequencies and an asymptotic expression for its mode shapes. These simple analytical formulas allow to understand the role played by each model parameter in the modal response and show that the axial force, the flexural rigidity and the rotational end stiffnesses can be correctly identified under some conditions, which are established and provided in this document. Among others, it is necessary that the identification procedure relies on the first few natural frequencies and mode shapes, which are measured near each extremity of the element, as well as some natural frequencies associated with higher modes.},

   abstract = {The generic model of a cable with small bending stiffness and anchored to flexible supports in rotation and translation is considered. An asymptotic analysis of the natural frequencies of this generic model is derived and shows that, for small bending stiffness, the first few natural frequencies can be expressed as a function of the cable axial force, the small bending stiffness and a single dimensionless group collecting the information of all other problem parameters. This formulation is used to develop an identification procedure of the cable axial force. Two formulations are proposed, one numerical and one semi-analytical based on a simple linear regression model. Both methods do not attempt at separately identifying the problem parameters since the observability analysis has revealed that only the cable axial force, the bending stiffness and the dimensionless group can be identified. In particular, the second method is very simple to implement and provides estimates of the cable axial force which account for the flexibility of the support. The proposed method can therefore be seen as an extension of usual identification techniques based on linear regressions of natural frequencies vs. mode number relations, by considering at the same time the bending stiffness and the deformability of supports. Being simple and robust as shown by means of an uncertainty quantification analysis, the proposed method can be conveniently embedded in the framework of a continuous monitoring strategy.},

   abstract = {The determination of tension in bridge cables by means of vibration measurements has been used by the Direction of civil engineering expertise for decades to monitor the bridges managed by the Walloon Region (SPW). Over time, it has appeared that the traditional methodology, based on sparse on-site measurement and the taut string theory, suffers from certain limitations: the two most important are the delay between measurements (at best once a year) and the difficulties in solving the equation linking the vibration response to the tension in the stay, in the case of short or geometrically complex cable. An agreement was concluded between the SPW, the University of Liège and V2i, a company specialised in vibrations, to develop a solution including a software allowing the tension determination in any kind of bridge cable and the hardware to monitor the cable tension remotely for a long time.},

   abstract = {© 2019 International Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division Air-water flows occur commonly in stepped spillways including the nappe flow regime for low flow rates. The present laboratory experiments researched the nappe flow regime in a stepped chute with prototype-scale steps height providing unique insights into the evolution of nappe flows along a stepped chute. Detailed visual observations highlighted the varying flow features along the stepped chute including the evolution of flow aeration, of jet properties and of instationarities in form of jump waves and cavity fluctuations with typical frequencies of around 1 Hz. These instationarities were caused by complex flow interactions at the impingement of the jet on the horizontal step face. Detailed air-water flow measurements revealed the complexity of the flows highlighting both S-shape and jet-like void fraction distributions and jet-like interfacial velocity distributions downstream of the jet impact and at step edges. This resulted in a downwards shift of the bubble count rate distributions closer to the step face. The nappe flows showed strong energy dissipation and reaeration performances along the stepped chute. The present study provided a robust and extensive characterisation of nappe flows and due to the large scale of the experiments, the results should provide confidence for the design of stepped chutes with embankment dam slope.},

   abstract = {In order to remotely monitor tension in a cable over time, an appropriate method is based on the natural frequencies of the cable measured by means of wireless accelerometers. In this paper, an existing method is extended to determine the tension in long or short shallow cables with small bending stiffness and arbitrary end conditions. First, a low-order analytical model is developed to compute the dynamic response of a given cable. Then, the unknown parameters such as the end conditions, the exact length of the cable and the tension in the cable are adjusted, using an iterative nonlinear least-square algorithm, until the computed natural frequencies and associated mode shapes match the measured ones. This procedure is finally validated with field measurements collected on long and short cables.},
