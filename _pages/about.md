I am currently working on Structural Health Monitoring projects at COWI, in Copenhagen, Denmark. I was previously conducting postdoctoral research in Prof. Kareem's team, the NatHaz (Natural Hazards) Modeling Laboratory, at the University of Notre Dame (IN, USA). This position was supported by a Francqui Fellowship of the Belgian American Education Foundation.
