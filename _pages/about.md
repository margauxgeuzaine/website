Welcome to this website, where I get you through my past experience and my vision for what is next in the field of <span class="font-weight-bold">Structural Health Monitoring</span>...! 

I consider myself to be quite a versatile research engineer, committed to translating complex technical concepts into actionable insights, excited by the opportunity to bridge the gap between academic and industry concerns, and keen to use innovative approaches to address the challenges faced when dealing with practical applications.

I am a Belgian national, essentially living abroad since I completed my Ph.D. at the University of Li√®ge in 2022, and currently working on the large-scale monitoring projects of COWI Transportation International, in Denmark. I am responsible for the development, the implementation, and the supervision of an in-house processing strategy dedicated to assessing the loading state of the supporting structures used during the excavation of a rock tunnel in Sweden. I am also involved in performing and documenting periodic health checks based on data recorded at the Normandie, Tancarville and Grand Canal Bridges in the North of France. 

Before that, I conducted some postdoctoral research at the University of Notre Dame, in the United States of America. This position was supported by a Francqui Fellowship of the Belgian American Education Foundation. Explanations about where I went and what I did can be found <span href="[font-weight-bold](https://www.uee.uliege.be/cms/c_8944062/en/margaux-geuzaine-researcher-in-structural-and-stochastic-dynamics-is-awarded-a-baef-fellowship-for-a-postdoctoral-stay-at-the-university-of-notre-dame)">here</span>.
