Welcome to this website, where I get you through my past experiences and my vision for what is next in the field of structural health monitoring! I usually like to present myself as a quite versatile research engineer, committed to translating complex technical concepts into actionable insights, excited by the opportunity to bridge the gap between academic research and practical applications, and keen to use innovative approaches to address the challenges faced by the industry.

I am currently working on Structural Health Monitoring projects at COWI, in Copenhagen, Denmark. I was previously conducting postdoctoral research in Prof. Kareem's team, the NatHaz (Natural Hazards) Modeling Laboratory, at the University of Notre Dame (IN, USA). This position was supported by a Francqui Fellowship of the Belgian American Education Foundation.
